# Workflow 


To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
        git@github.com:mutua-mutinda/workflow.git



        cd workflow
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run dev

   # Using Yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:3000.

# Building for production
To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

   ```bash
        # Using npm
        npm run build
        npm run serve

        # Using Yarn
        yarn build
        yarn serve
   ```
After that's done, check out `./dist` to see the optimized output.
